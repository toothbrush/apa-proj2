README file for the 4th assignment of Compiler Construction

Type inference

13th April, 2011

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR THE RUSHED

$ cd `mktemp -d`
$ tar xvvzf types.tgz
$ cd fun-0.0.4/
$ make
$ cat examples/assignment.hm | parse-hm | hm2systemf | pp-systemf

IMPORTANT: latex-doc/main.pdf

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR THE IMPATIENT

To get started, unpack this tarball (evidently this was successful if you're reading
this), and run:

$ make

and optionally 

$ cabal install # this is so you can run the commands directly, 
                # without invocations like `dist/build/parse-bib/parse-bib`. 

For documentation:

$ make documentation

Documentation gets placed in dist/doc/html/fun/index.html (this is a good starting
point). To try out the various examples, assuming you have run `cabal install`, try 
the following:

$ cat examples/exampleX.hm | parse-hm | hm2systemf | pp-systemf

or if you'd rather not install, prefix all executables with dist/build/<exec-name>/. 
Or equivalently, use the included alias:

$ ./test.sh examples/exampleX.hm

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLES

A number of examples are included, see ./examples/, the specifics of each examle
will be explained in the documentation.

FOR THE PATIENT (or the more curious)

Features

* Infers types for all valid Hindley-Milner programs, as defined in 
  the assignment,
* Fails with a reasonable type-error if something is wrong.

In a future version, possibilities for improvement include:

* Could be a little smarter; for example, the generalise/substitution
  could happen at the end to save redundant abstractions.
* Even better errors. 

Requirements:

This package has been tested on Mac OS X.6 and Linux 2.6.35, using GHC6.12.3 and GHC7.0.1.
Also required are at least the following packages (can be obtained via the Haskell Cabal):

- cco
- haskell98

Documentation:

For extensive documentation, as well as a report detailing implementational details and 
architecture of this suite, we refer the reader to the Haddock generated documentation, and the 
PDF architecture notes. Both can be obtained by running

$ make documentation

and opening the resulting file, dist/doc/html/fun/index.html. This file includes
an introduction as well as links to the rest of the documentation. There is also a PDF 
document explaining implementation details and design choices, to be found in latex-doc/main.pdf.
